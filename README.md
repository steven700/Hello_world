## My first step toward the future. 
Anything you wish is what your mind reflection. If you feel like need it why not build it by yourself.
I spent my hours with my family. I feel the world surrounding us is just life and memory. 
I am thinking about why Amos spent 2 hours on his homework. It is difficult for me to bear that. So I try to free him and me for a while. 
I suggested "You can do anything except homework". He falled into Harry Potter for 40 minutes. Then back to homework for 30 minutes. 
Yes, you need something different in your journey.
